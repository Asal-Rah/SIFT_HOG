# SIFT_HOG
In this project, sift and hog were applied to a set of images for feature extraction.
In fact, I analyzed if any of the images in this set exist in the original image or not. Since, sift and hog are both feature detection methods used in computer vision, I used them for matching the set of images to the main image.
